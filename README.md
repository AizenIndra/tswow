# TSWoW

_Please note: TSWoW is in early development stage. While we have a lot of features implemented, there are still many things left to add and the editor environment has a few stability issues._

TSWoW (TypeScript WoW) is a **free** modding framework, mod loader and integrated development environment for the World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King (WotLK) expansion.

With TSWoW, you use the TypeScript programming language and the VSCodium editor to easily modify the World of Warcraft game data and to script the behavior of the server.

_TSWoW is **not** a new server emulator, we have a standard C++ emulator forked off modern [TrinityCore](https://github.com/tswow/TrinityCore/tree/tswow) and stay close to this upstream. We use a highly effective TypeScript->C++ transpiler for server scripts._

## Who is TSWoW for?

- Modding Beginners - We have [crash course](https://tswow.github.io/tswow-wiki/home/) aimed just at getting new people started!

- Modding Veterans - TSWoW is primarily aimed at making modding more efficient and powerful. You will very fast realize the power of improving your workflow using programming instead of GUIs.

TSWoW is a **programming environment**, and the language we use is _TypeScript_. This is among the easier languages to learn, and is very similar to Java, C#, JavaScript, Python etc. If you know any of those, you can probably learn TSWoW by just following the crash course. However, if any of the following is foreign to you then you might want to review them before you get started:

- Integrated development environment (IDE)
- JSON
- Functions, objects, classes, methods
- Callback functions / Delegates
- Command-line interface
